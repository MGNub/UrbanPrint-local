            <h2>USA'S EXCESSIVE</h2><h2>DEPENDENCE ON CARS</h2>
            <p>While the automobile has grown to be an American staple over the last century, there are many issues that came along with it. American society has grown extremely dependent on cars, and its cities have been designed and built around cars, making it nearly impossible to thrive in modern America without a motor vehicle.</p>
            <p>Attempting to sustain such a car-centric society is extremely costly. It comes at the heavy price of public health, highly congested and ugly roads, huge wastes of land, environmental harm, and much more.</p>
